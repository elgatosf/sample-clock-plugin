# Sample Clock Plugin

This tiny plugin demonstrates how to include the javascript library into a plugin and how to use the library (in less than 100 lines of code - including a dynamic SVG icon and all code necessary to make use of `setImage`, `setFeedback`, `dialRotate`, `dialPress` and `touchTap`

## What it does

* it uses our built-in `$A1` layout for this
* it shows the weekday in the title (you can switch that off in the PI)
* you can show/hide seconds by tapping the panel
* you can show/hide seconds by pressing the dial
